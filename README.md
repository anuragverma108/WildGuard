# 🌿 WildGuard 🌿

*‘Until we consider animal life to be worthy of the consideration and reverence we bestow upon old books and pictures and historic monuments, there will always be the animal refugee living a precarious life on the edge of extermination, dependent for existence on the charity of a few human beings.’*<br>

*– Gerald Durrell*
